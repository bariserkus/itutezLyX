# itutezLyX
Istanbul Technical University M.S. and Ph.D. Thesis in LyX (UNOFFICIAL)

This is a LyX template/structure for Istanbul Technical University, Faculty of Engineering M.S. and Ph.D. Thesis.

There are several things that needs to be done before starting to use the template files.

1. Need to install itutez.cls and itutex.bst files to your LaTeX system.
2. Install itutez.layout file to LyX
3. Understand how ch??LyX.lyx files work.
4. Understand how input *.tex files work.
5. All files have to be UTF8 encoded. If it is LyX file, this has to be done from Settings > Language > Encoding.

I will prepare help files as soon as possible.
