abstract = {Abstract The dynamic, bi‐linear response behaviour of a series of eight storey shear buildings subjected to simulated earthquake excitation is studied. The specific objective of the investigation is to determine under what conditions a yielding first storey can adequately protect the upper storeys from significant yielding. Two classes of buildings are considered: stiff (0.5 sec period) and flexible (2.0 sec period), and the basic parameters considered in the yielding first storey are the yield force level and the bi‐linear stiffness. The results demonstrate that a very low yield force level and an essentially perfectly plastic yielding mechanism are required in the first storey to provide effective protection to the superstructure. Moreover, the required displacement capacity of such an effective first storey mechanism is found to be very large.}

abstract={In the design of structural systems such as nuclear reactor coolant loops consisting of piping, supports, bumpers, and tie rods, the basic structure is linear. For transient analysis of piping loops under conditions of earthquake and hypothetical accident of pipe rupture, the linear system becomes nonlinear because of forces due to bottoming in gaps, plastic action in the bumper stops or tie rods, etc. The dynamic analysis of such a structure normally employs the direct integration of the governing nonlinear equations of motion. A technique is presented in this paper where conventional normal mode theory is used even though there are nonlinearities. Nonlinearities such as bumper-gap elements, plasticity, etc., are defined as functions of motion and incorporated as generalized pseudoforces. This approach can, to a considerable degree, preserve the benefits of modal type analysis such as physical understanding in terms of frequencies and modes, and adequate and economical solutions using a reduced number of modes.},

abstract={Based on a Markov-vector formulation and a Galerkin solution procedure, a new method of modeling and solution of a large class of hysteretic systems (softening or hardening, narrow or wide-band) under random excitation is proposed. The excitation is modeled as a filtered Gaussian shot noise allowing one to take the nonstationarity and spectral content of the excitation into consideration. The solutions include time histories of joint density, moments of all order, and threshold crossing rate; for the stationary case, autocorrelation, spectral density, and first passage time probability are also obtained. Comparison of results of numerical example with Monte-Carlo solutions indicates that the proposed method is a powerful and efficient tool.},

abstract = { In base‐isolated structures specially designed isolation systems provide the needed flexibility and energy dissipation capacity. The isolation systems, which can be either elastomeric or sliding systems, exhibit highly nonlinear behavior. The existing algorithms cannot analyze base‐isolated structures with sliding isolation systems accurately. This paper presents an analytical model and a solution algorithm developed for nonlinear dynamic analysis of three‐dimensional‐base‐isolated structures with elastomeric and/or sliding isolation systems. The novelty of the analytical model and solution algorithm is its capability to capture the highly nonlinear frictional behavior of sliding isolation systems in plane motion. Nonlinear behavior is restricted to the base and the superstructure is considered to be elastic at all times. Biaxial and uniaxial models, which can represent both elastomeric and sliding isolation bearings, are presented. The solution algorithm consisting of the pseudoforce method with iteration is presented. Comparison of computed results with experimental results is presented for verification. A six‐story‐reinforced‐concrete‐base‐isolated structure is analyzed. }

abstract="More than 23,000 structures, located in over 30 countries, have been so far protected by passive anti-seismic (AS) systems, mainly by the seismic isolation (SI) and energy dissipation (ED) ones. The use of such systems is going on increasing everywhere, although its extent is strongly influenced by earthquake lessons and the features of the design rules used. As to the latter, SI is considered as an additional safety measure (with consequent significant additional construction costs) in some countries (Japan, USA, etc.), while, in others (including Italy), the codes allow to partly take into account the reduction of the seismic forces acting on the superstructure that is induced by SI. Applications of the AS systems have been made to both new and existing civil and industrial structures of all kinds. The latter include some high risk (HR) plants (nuclear reactors and chemical installations). The applications in a civil context already include not only strategic and public structures, but also residential buildings and even many small private houses. In Italy, the use of the AS systems has become more and more popular especially after the 2009 Abruzzo earthquake (nowadays more than 400 Italian buildings are seismically isolated). Based on the information provided by the authors at the ASSISi 13th World Conference, held in Sendai (Japan) in September 2013, and on more recent data, the paper summarizes the state-of-the-art of the development and application of the AS systems and devices at worldwide level, by devoting particular attention to SI of buildings in Italy, in the context of recent seismic events. Moreover, it outlines the benefits of the aforesaid systems for ensuring the indispensable absolute integrity of strategic and public structures, as, primarily, schools, hospitals and HR plants, but also (for an adequate protection of cultural heritage) museums. Finally, based on Italian experience, it provides some remarks on costs of SI, stresses the conditions for the correct use of this technique and mentions some recent initiatives of the Italian Parliament to ensure such a correct use and to widely extend such an use to the HR chemical plants too (for which only very few applications already exist in Italy).",

abstract = {SUMMARY The nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011 has led the nuclear community to consider seismic isolation for new large light water and small modular reactors to withstand the effects of beyond design basis loadings, including extreme earthquakes. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is sponsoring a research project that will quantify the response of low damping rubber (LDR) and lead rubber (LR) bearings under loadings associated with extreme earthquakes. Under design basis loadings, the response of an elastomeric bearing is not expected to deviate from well‐established numerical models, and bearings are not expected to experience net tension. However, under extended or beyond design basis shaking, elastomer shear strains may exceed 300\% in regions of high seismic hazard, bearings may experience net tension, the compression and tension stiffness will be affected by isolator lateral displacement, and the properties of the lead core in LR bearings will degrade in the short‐term because of substantial energy dissipation. New mathematical models of LDR and LR bearings are presented for the analysis of base isolated structures under design and beyond design basis shaking, explicitly considering both the effects of lateral displacement and cyclic vertical and horizontal loading. These mathematical models extend the available formulations in shear and compression. Phenomenological models are presented to describe the behavior of elastomeric isolation bearings in tension, including the cavitation and post‐cavitation behavior. The elastic mechanical properties make use of the two‐spring model. Strength degradation of LR bearing under cyclic shear loading due to heating of lead core is incorporated. The bilinear area reduction method is used to include variation of critical buckling load capacity with lateral displacement. The numerical models are coded in OpenSees, and the results of numerical analysis are compared with test data. The effect of different parameters on the response is investigated through a series of analyses. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}
